# weave

A local, file-based **ticket board + codebase map + Claude Code skills** you can
drop into any repo. Clone it, run one setup script against your project, and you
get a localhost dashboard, a graph of your codebase, and a backlog that fills
itself from a bug-scan of your own code.

No database. No build pipeline. No external services. Markdown files on disk are
the source of truth, served by a tiny [Bun](https://bun.sh) process on
`127.0.0.1`.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <this-repo> weave
cd weave
bash setup.sh /path/to/your/repo      # defaults to the current directory

cd /path/to/your/repo/.weave
bun run start                          # → http://127.0.0.1:5174
```

That's it. Open the URL and you'll see your board, your codebase graph, and (if
Claude Code is installed) a backlog of real findings from your code.

### Requirements

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** — runs the dashboard and the CLI. *(required)*
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — powers the `repo-map` and
  `bug-scan` skills. *(optional, but it's the point)*
- **python3** — for the optional end-of-turn skill-reflection hook. *(optional)*

---

## What `setup.sh` does

1. **Vendors the app** — copies the Bun dashboard into `your-repo/.weave/`.
2. **Installs the skills + hook** into `your-repo/.claude/`, merging weave's hook
   into any existing `.claude/settings.json` (idempotent, non-destructive).
3. **Scaffolds the board** — `your-repo/.tickets/` with the 9 lifecycle buckets
   and an `ADRs/` folder.
4. **Writes `weave.config.json`** and a starter `CLAUDE.md` (only if you don't
   already have one).
5. **Builds the dashboard graphs** — deterministic, no Claude needed.
6. **Runs `repo-map`** (if Claude Code is present) — a richer codebase map.
7. **Runs `bug-scan`** (if Claude Code is present) — files verified bugs into the
   backlog. The board is populated by *your* code from minute one.

Flags: `--no-scan` (skip steps 6–7), `--start` (launch the board at the end),
`--port N`.

> The headless skill passes (`claude -p …`) are best-effort. If they don't fully
> complete under your permission settings, just run them interactively in Claude
> Code: `/repo-map` and `/bug-scan`. Everything else in setup is deterministic.

## The board

Tickets are markdown files with YAML frontmatter. They flow through buckets:

```
scratch → 0-backlog → 1-staging → 3-building → 4-testing → 5-validating → 6-complete → 7-archive
                                  ↘ 2-stuck ↗
```

Drag tickets between buckets in the UI, edit them in the browser, or let the
`ticket-manager` skill drive the lifecycle. Completed tickets auto-archive after
7 days.

## The graphs (`/graphs/...`)

| View | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **repo-map** | Your codebase — directories, files, and relative-import edges. A filesystem-walk heuristic by default; the `repo-map` skill writes a richer map. |
| **tickets** | `depends_on` / `blocks` / `related` across the board. |
| **skills** | Your Claude Code skill portfolio (`connects_to` orchestration graph). |
| **ai** | The full Claude Code ecosystem — skills, agents, hooks, MCP, settings. |
| **adrs** | Architecture Decision Records and the tickets that implement them. |

## The skills

| Skill | Kind | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ticket-manager` | utility | Owns the `.tickets/` lifecycle. The hub. |
| `repo-map` | generator | Introspects the repo → writes `repo-map-graph.json`. |
| `bug-scan` | workflow | Fan-out bug hunt → adversarial verify → files backlog tickets. |
| `adr-manager` | workflow | Create / transition / link Architecture Decision Records. |
| `adr-researcher` | audit | Researches a decision and drafts an ADR. |
| `security` (+ `-frontend` / `-backend` / `-gcp`) | audit | Read-only security audits → severity-ranked findings. |
| `skill-builder` | utility | Author and audit skills. |
| `skill-generator` | generator | Bootstrap a skill portfolio for a new repo. |
| `skill-organizer` | orchestrator | Curate an existing portfolio (merges, renames, retirements). |

## Configuration

The vendored layout (`<repo>/.weave` beside `<repo>/.tickets` and
`<repo>/.claude`) works with zero config. To override, edit `weave.config.json`
at your repo root or set env vars:

| Setting | `weave.config.json` | env var | default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Repo root | `repoRoot` | `WEAVE_REPO_ROOT` | parent of `.weave/` |
| Tickets dir | `ticketsRoot` | `WEAVE_TICKETS_ROOT` | `<repo>/.tickets` |
| ADRs dir | `adrsRoot` | `WEAVE_ADRS_ROOT` | `<tickets>/ADRs` |
| Port | `port` | `PORT` | `5174` |

## Notes

- **File-based, localhost-only.** The server binds `127.0.0.1`, has no auth layer,
  and **never runs git** — you own commits.
- `.weave/cache/` holds generated graph JSON; it's safe to delete (rebuilt on
  demand) and is gitignored.
- The board's data — `.tickets/` — is plain markdown. Commit it to version your
  backlog alongside your code, or gitignore it to keep it local.
