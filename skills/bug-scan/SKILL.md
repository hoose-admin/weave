# Bug Scan

Hunt for real bugs across a repo and file the confirmed ones as backlog tickets. Built to run both headlessly (`claude -p "/bug-scan"`, the path `setup.sh` uses on first install) and interactively.

The product contract: the board is seeded by **real findings from the user's own code**, never demo/seed data. That makes false-positive control the whole game — a backlog full of phantom bugs is worse than an empty one. Every finding clears an adversarial refute pass before it becomes a ticket.

`ultrathink` — correctness judgments and refutations need careful reasoning, not pattern-matching.

## When to invoke

- "scan for bugs" / "find bugs and file tickets" / "bug hunt this repo" → full scan
- "audit the code for bugs" → full scan
- Automatically by `setup.sh` on first install (headless `claude -p`).

## When NOT to invoke

- **Security-only sweep** → invoke the `security` skill directly. This skill *calls* it as one lens; it is not a security entry point.
- **Per-PR / diff review** → `/code-review` or `/security-review` (change-scoped). bug-scan sweeps the whole tree.
- **Style / lint / formatting** → a linter. This skill files *bugs* (wrong behavior, crashes, data corruption), not nits.
- **A known specific bug the user already located** → just fix it, or file one ticket via `ticket-manager`. Don't spin up the whole fan-out for one item.

## Standing rules

- **Read-only on the user's code.** The ONLY writes are new ticket markdown files created through the ticket CLI (or the dashboard API). Never edit, never fix inline.
- **Never run git. Never install anything.** No `git`, no `bun add`, no `npm install`, no downloads.
- **Verify before filing.** A candidate that has not survived an independent refute pass is not a finding. Zero false-positive spam is the bar.
- **Cap and log — never silently truncate.** Default cap ≤ 15 tickets/run. If more survive, file the top-N by severity and LOG the truncated remainder (titles + one-line reason) in the final report.
- **De-dupe against the existing backlog** so re-runs don't refile the same bug.

## Definitions

- **REPO_ROOT** — the repository being scanned: the directory that contains `.weave/`. In a vendored install, the ticket CLI is at `REPO_ROOT/.weave/scripts/ticket-cli.ts`. (In *this* source repo only, it lives at `app/.weave/scripts/ticket-cli.ts` — do not hardcode that path in a scanned project.) Resolve REPO_ROOT by walking up from the cwd to the nearest `.weave/` directory.
- **Finder** — a subagent assigned one bug dimension over a slice of the tree.
- **Refuter** — an independent second opinion whose only job is to try to prove a candidate is NOT a real bug.

## Procedure

### 1. Orient

1. Resolve REPO_ROOT (nearest ancestor containing `.weave/`). All CLI calls run from there.
2. Confirm the CLI flags before filing anything: `Read REPO_ROOT/.weave/scripts/ticket-cli.ts`. Confirm `create` still takes `--title`, `--domain`, `--priority`, `--bucket`, `--body-file`. If the flags drifted, adapt the filing command in step 5 to match the file — never file against a guessed interface.
3. Size the repo (rough source-file count, excluding `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `.next/`, `__pycache__/`, vendored deps, lockfiles). This sets finder count (step 2).

### 2. Fan out finders

Prefer the **Workflow tool** if available in this environment for the fan-out; otherwise spawn **parallel `Agent` subagents** (place all spawns in a single message so they run concurrently). Read-only finders may use the `Explore` agent.

Dimensions (one finder per dimension at minimum; split a dimension across multiple finders for a large tree):

| Dimension | Hunt for |
|---|---|
| Correctness / logic | wrong conditionals, inverted comparisons, bad control flow, wrong return values, broken invariants, mis-implemented algorithms |
| Errors / edge cases | unhandled exceptions, swallowed errors, missing null/empty/boundary handling, unchecked external/IO/parse results, partial-failure paths |
| Resource / concurrency / state | leaks (fds, handles, connections), races, shared-mutable-state corruption, missing cleanup, await/async misuse, ordering bugs |
| Risky patterns | injection (SQL/shell/path), unsafe parsing/deserialization, off-by-one, null/undefined deref, unchecked type coercions, footguns |
| **Security** | **DELEGATE to the `security` skill** — read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../security/SKILL.md`, invoke it as the security lens, and feed its P0/P1/P2 findings into the same refute → file pipeline. Do not reimplement security checks here. |

**Finder contract** — each finder returns a list of candidates, each with: short title, `file:line` cite(s), a one-paragraph *why it's a bug* (the failing input / sequence / state), and a self-rated severity (high/med/low). No fixes from finders; that's step 5.

**Scale to repo size:** small repo (≲50 source files) → ~5 finders (one per dimension). Larger → split the heavier dimensions (correctness, security) across the tree by directory so no finder reads more than it can hold. Don't over-spawn a tiny repo.

### 3. Adversarially verify (refute pass)

This is the step that protects the backlog. For **every** candidate from step 2:

1. Spawn an **independent** refuter (fresh `Agent`, no finder context) whose sole task is: *"Try to prove this is NOT a real bug."* Give it the candidate's title, cites, and reasoning, and have it re-read the cited code cold.
2. The refuter checks the usual false-positive sources: a guard/validation upstream the finder missed, a caller-side invariant that makes the bad input impossible, dead/unreachable code, intended behavior, a framework/runtime guarantee, a test that already pins the behavior.
3. **Kill any candidate the refuter can plausibly defeat.** Survivors are candidates where the refuter could NOT construct a defense — the bug stands. Keep the refuter's reasoning; it becomes ticket Context.

Batch refuters in parallel (single message, multiple spawns) when there are several candidates.

### 4. De-dupe and cap

1. **De-dupe against the backlog.** Glob `REPO_ROOT/.tickets/0-backlog/TKT-*.md` (also scan `1-staging` … `5-validating` so a bug already in-flight isn't refiled; skip `6-complete`/`7-archive`). For each survivor, compare title + primary `file:line` cite against existing tickets. A match → drop the survivor and note it as "already tracked: TKT-NNN" in the report.
2. **Run the ID/board sanity check** before filing: `bun .weave/scripts/ticket-cli.ts audit-ids` (from REPO_ROOT). If it reports collisions, surface that in the report — but still file (the CLI allocates fresh IDs; pre-existing collisions are a separate board-hygiene problem).
3. **Cap.** If survivors after de-dupe exceed the cap (default 15), sort by severity (high → med → low) and keep the top N. Everything cut is **logged** in the final report (title + one-line reason), never dropped silently.

### 5. File survivors as backlog tickets

For each capped survivor, write an actionable ticket body to a tmpfile, then file it via the CLI. **Map severity → priority** (high→High, med→Medium, low→Low) and **infer `domain`** from where the bug lives (`app` for application/source code, `infra` for build/CI/deploy/config, `docs` for documentation, `meta` for tooling/workflow). The body MUST contain, in this order: `### Objective`, `### Context` (with `file:line` cites + why it's a bug, carrying the refuter's surviving reasoning), `### Acceptance Criteria` (checkbox list), and a suggested fix. See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/TICKET_BODY.md` for the exact shape.

**The filing command** (run from REPO_ROOT; one invocation per confirmed bug):

```
bun .weave/scripts/ticket-cli.ts create \
  --title "<concise bug title>" \
  --domain <app|infra|docs|meta> \
  --priority <Low|Medium|High> \
  --bucket 0-backlog \
  --body-file <tmpfile>
```

- **Never hand-pick IDs.** The CLI uses the same `nextTicketId()` allocator as the dashboard and prints the new `TKT-NNN` on stdout — capture it for the report.
- New bugs land in `0-backlog` (the prioritization queue), never `1-staging`.
- **Alternative (only when the dashboard server is already running):** POST the same body to `/api/tickets`. Prefer the CLI — `setup.sh` runs bug-scan *before* the server starts, so the CLI is the path that always works.
- Clean up tmpfiles after filing.

### 6. Report

Emit a concise summary: finders run, candidates found, candidates killed by refute, survivors filed (with their `TKT-NNN`s + titles), already-tracked dupes skipped, and the **truncation log** if the cap was hit. This is the surface `setup.sh` shows the user after the first scan.

## Inputs

| param | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cap=<N>` | `15` | max tickets filed this run; remainder logged |
| `dimensions=<list>` | all 5 | restrict the fan-out (e.g. `correctness,security`) |
| `path=<subdir>` | REPO_ROOT | scan a subtree instead of the whole repo |

## Prerequisites

- `bun` on PATH (the ticket CLI is Bun). If absent, STOP and report — do not install it.
- REPO_ROOT contains `.weave/scripts/ticket-cli.ts` and a `.tickets/` tree (the dashboard scaffolds both).
- The `security` skill is installed (this skill delegates the security lens to it). If missing, run the other four dimensions and note the gap in the report.

## References

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/TICKET_BODY.md` — exact ticket-body template (Objective / Context / Acceptance Criteria / Suggested fix) + severity→priority and domain-inference rules.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT fix bugs — files them. Remediation is a separate `ticket-manager` build flow.
- Does NOT run git or install packages.
- Does NOT seed demo/placeholder tickets — every ticket is a refute-survived finding from the user's own code.
- Does NOT silently truncate — the cap is logged.
