### Objective
<Clear, structural description of what needs to be built, fixed, or changed.
Include the WHY — what user-visible behavior or system property motivates this.>

### Context
<Concrete pointers gathered from the codebase before this ticket was written:
relevant files (file:line), existing patterns to follow or diverge from,
adjacent tickets, ADRs, or memory entries. This section is what makes the
ticket actionable without re-discovery. Omit ONLY if the work is truly
context-free (rare).>

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <Measurable, testable check 1>
- [ ] <Measurable, testable check 2>
- [ ] <…>

### Out of Scope
<Optional. Anything a reader might assume is included but isn't.>

### Notes
<Optional. Open questions, risks, follow-ups.>

### Implementation Summary
<!-- Populated automatically by the ticket-manager skill when this ticket moves to 4-testing.
     Do not fill in manually before implementation is complete. -->
<Empty until the ticket reaches 4-testing.>
